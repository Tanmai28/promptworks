Multimodal AI refers to models that process and understand multiple types of data, like text, images, audio, and video, simultaneously. These models can analyze an image, read a sentence, and understand how both relate.

OpenAI’s CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is one of the most powerful examples. Trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs, CLIP can “see” an image and “read” text in the same semantic space, which allows you to compare the two directly.
