 - It's totally possible for multiple slots to have the same slot type.
 - When two slots have the same slot type, it becomes important that you're using clear slot names, like sourceAccountType and targetAccountType, to make it easy to identify their differences.

ðŸ’¡ **What are confirmation prompts?**
 - Confirmation prompts typically repeat back information for the user to confirm. e.g. "Are you sure you want to do x?" If the user confirms the intent, the bot fulfills the intent
 - If the user declines, then the bot responds with a decline response that you set up.

1. This flow will update as you continue editing this intent.
2. It shows every step in a conversation in a logical, chronological order.
3. You'll also see some blank 'ghost like' responses. These are recommendations for what you could add to your Intent set up and they're clickable!
4. If you click on the chat bubble, you'll get taken to an edit screen.
