## Creating a new bot from scratch on Amazon Lex.


### STEP 1: **Set up the Lex Chatbot**

 - Amazon Lex needs the permission to call other AWS services on your behalf, later in this project series you'll be integrating Lex with another service called Lambda!
 - Amazon Lex will only maintain a session for a set length of time. If the user is idle and doesn't add any input for 5 minutes, their session will end.

- These voices are borrowed from Amazon Polly, which is another AWS service all about turning your text into speech!
- When you're using Amazon Lex to build a chatbot, this intent classification confidence score threshold is like a minimum score for your chatbot to confidently understand what the user is trying to say. Setting this to 0.4 means that your chatbot needs to be at least 40% confident that it understands what the user is asking to be able to give a response. So if a user's input is ambiguous and your chatbot's confidence score is below 0.4, it'll throw an error message.


### STEP 2: **Creating the first intent**

- When your bot is created, you will automatically see a page called Intent: NewIntent.
- An intent is what the user is trying to achieve in their conversation with the chatbot. For example, checking a bank account balance; booking a flight; ordering food. In Amazon Lex, you build your chatbot by defining and categorising different intents. If you set up different intents, one single chatbot can manage a bunch of requests that are usually related to each other.

ðŸ’¡ **How does my chatbot respond to these user inputs?**
 - The first three are successfully recognized - Amazon Lex is able to use its ML techniques to match what you have said against your utterances.
 - But the last two fail, resulting in an Intent FallbackIntent is fulfilled response - meaning Amazon Lex doesn't quite recognize your utterance. We'll learn what FallbackIntent means in the next step.



### STEP 3: **Manage FallbackIntent**

ðŸ’¡ **What is FallbackIntent?**
 - Remember the intent classification confidence score threshold, and how it's been set to 0.4? If your chatbot has a confidence score below 40% for all the intents you've defined (in our case, it's just the WelcomeIntent for now), the FallbackIntent is triggered.
 - Think of it as a custom error message that your chatbot will use to tell the user it doesn't understand their input.

 - Variations are literally variations of the same Message in the main Message box. When Amazon Lex needs to return a Fallback response, it will randomly choose a message from the group and return that.
 - Variations will give your users a dynamic range of responses, making them sound more conversational!
