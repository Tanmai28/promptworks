## Deploy your bot

Engineers and teams think about how they can be more efficient in the way they develop and deploy things all the time. This means it's very valuable to know how to automate manual processes like how we've been setting up BankerBot.

**ü•Å Introducing... AWS CloudFormation!**

**AWS CloudFormation** is a service that gives you an easy way to create and set up AWS resources.

It's an infrastructure as code service - meaning you will use a file that describes all the resources you want to create and their dependencies as code. Then, you can use that template to create, update, and delete the entire stack of resources you described, instead of managing your resources individually

CloudFormation is a super time saver. Let's give it a try with our BankerBot!

The great thing about deleting a CloudFormation stack is that all the resources it created will get cleaned up at the same time for you - no need to search around your console and delete resources one by one!
