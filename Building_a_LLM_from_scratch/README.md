## Building a Large Language Model from Scratch 
- Language model built will be to **predict the next word**.

Modern language models (like GPT-4) use transformers, a deep learning architecture that learns word relationships through self-attention. so built a basic transformer-based model to understand how to build a large language model from scratch.

Here are the six main components :

 1. Tokenization
 2. Embedding Layer
 3. Positional Encoding
 4. Self-Attention
 5. Transformer Block
 6. Full Language Model


**STEP 1: Tokenization**

Computers can’t understand words directly, so we map each word to a unique number (ID). This process is called tokenization. 

1. **text.split()**: Splits a sentence into words (e.g., “hello world”: [“hello”, “world”]).
2. **vocab**: A dictionary that assigns numbers to words (e.g., {“hello”: 0, “world”: 1, “<UNK>”: 2}).
3. **vocab.get(word, vocab[“<UNK>”])**: Returns a word’s assigned number. If it’s missing, assigns <UNK> (unknown).
Think of this as giving each word an ID, so the model can work with numbers instead of text.

**STEP 2: Embedding Layer**

Numbers alone (like 0 and 1) don’t carry meaning. An embedding layer transforms these numbers into vectors (lists of numbers), allowing words with similar meanings to have similar representations.

1. **nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)**: Creates a table where each word ID maps to a vector.
2. **embedding_dim**: Defines the length of each vector (e.g., 16 numbers per word).
Think of embeddings as assigning each word a personality, so words like happy and joyful get similar vectors.

**STEP 3: Positional Encoding**

Transformers process all words at once, so they don’t naturally understand order (e.g., “I am here” ≠ “here you I”). Positional encoding fixes this by adding a unique “position signal” to each word. 

1. **embedding_dim**: Matches the vector size from the embedding layer.
2. **max_seq_len**: The longest sentence we’ll handle (e.g., 5000 words).
3. **Math (sine and cosine)**: Creates a pattern of numbers that change based on position (e.g., word 1 gets one pattern, word 2 gets another).
4. **forward**: Adds these position numbers to the word vectors.
Think of this as tagging each word with a position stamp so the model understands word order.

**STEP 4: Self-Attention**

Self-attention helps the model focus on important words. For example, in “The cat sat on the mat”, “sat” relates more to “cat” than “mat”. 

1. **query, key, value**: Three transformations of the input vectors. Think of them as asking “What do I care about?” (query), “What’s available?” (key), and “What do I take?” (value).
2. **scores**: Measures how much each word relates to every other word.
3. **attention_weights**: Turns scores into probabilities (e.g., 70% focus on “how”, 30% on “are”).
4. **attended_values**: Combines the important parts of the sentence.

**STEP 5: Transformer Block**

A single attention layer isn’t enough. Transformer blocks combine attention with deeper processing.

1. **attention**: The self-attention we just built.
2. **feed_forward**: A small neural network to process each word further.
3. **norm1, norm2**: Normalizes the numbers so they don’t get too big or small (like keeping everyone on the same scale).
4. **x + attended**: Adds the original input to the attention output (a trick called “residual connection”).

**Step 6: Full Language Model**

Now, combining all the pieces into one model that predicts the next word.

1. **num_layers**: How many transformer blocks to stack (more layers = deeper thinking).
2. **output**: Turns the final vectors back into word predictions (e.g., probabilities for each word in the vocab).

This is the final system, it reads the sentence, understands it, and guesses the next word.

**STEP 7: Training the Model**

Will teach the model by showing it examples and correcting its mistakes

1. **input_seq**: The words so far (e.g., [0, 1] for “hello world”).
2. **target**: The next word (e.g., 2 for “how”).
3. **loss**: How far off the prediction was.
4. **optimizer.step()**: Updates the model to improve.

**STEP 8: Using the Model**

Now, predicting the next word using our model

**How to Build an Actual LLM with this?**

To scale this prototype into a real LLM, the vocabulary must expand from 6 to 50,000+ tokens using subword methods like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or Hugging Face tokenizers. Training should use millions of sentences from large text corpora instead of just two. The embedding size should increase from 16 to 512–1024, and hidden dimensions from 32 to 2048+, with 12–96 transformer layers similar to GPT models. Replace simple self-attention with multi-head attention (nn.MultiheadAttention) for richer context. Training should shift from CPU to multi-GPU/TPU setups with batching, gradient clipping, and learning rate schedulers, using frameworks like PyTorch Lightning or DeepSpeed for efficiency. High-end hardware (e.g., multiple NVIDIA A100 GPUs) is essential for practical large-scale training.
